# Data Cleaning Project

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning a dataset stored in a CSV file, using SQL to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and optimize data quality. The goal of this project was to transform raw, messy data into a clean, usable form to support further data analysis and insights.

The dataset originally contained various issues like missing values, incorrect data types, and redundant information. I tackled these challenges systematically to ensure the dataset could be effectively used for meaningful analysis.

## Project Structure

- **`Cleaning Data.sql`**: This SQL script contains the code used to clean the dataset. The cleaning process involved tasks such as handling NULL values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates.

## Steps Involved

1. **Loading the Dataset**: The raw data was imported into a SQL database for easier manipulation.

2. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were handled by either filling in appropriate default values or removing the rows/columns depending on their relevance to the dataset.

3. **Standardizing Data Formats**: Data types were standardized (e.g., dates, numerical values) to ensure consistency across the dataset.

4. **Removing Redundancies**: Duplicate rows were removed, and redundant columns were dropped to streamline the dataset.

5. **Data Validation**: After cleaning, various queries were run to verify data integrity and ensure the cleaning process was successful.

## Key SQL Techniques Used

- **`UPDATE` and `SET`** statements to replace missing values.
- **`JOIN` operations** to enrich data where multiple sources were available.
- **`DELETE` statements** to remove irrelevant or duplicate data.
- **`CAST` and `CONVERT`** functions to standardize data types.

## Results

After cleaning, the dataset was significantly improved, with consistent data types, no duplicates, and minimal missing values. This makes it ready for further exploratory data analysis or feeding into a machine learning model.

## How to Use This Repository

- Clone the repository and use any SQL database to execute the `Cleaning Data.sql` script.
- Make sure to adjust any file paths or table names based on your environment.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: The entire cleaning process was carried out using SQL.
- **Database**: Any SQL-compatible database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite can be used.

## Future Improvements

- Expand the script to handle additional data cleaning needs based on new datasets.
- Implement further automation to integrate the cleaning process within an ETL pipeline.
